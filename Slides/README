Reinforcement Learning for Artificial Intelligence  
Course Description:  

This course covers the modeling concepts and the underlying recursive functions behind 
reinforcement learning. A substantial part of the material is devoted to modern algorithms for 
solving the underlying model including deep Q-networks, policy gradient, Monte-Carlo tree 
search, and actor-critic algorithms. Through homework assignments and projects, students 
implement and evaluate these algorithms in Python.  

Course Objectives:  
At the end of the course students should be able to:  
1. Given a business problem identify if reinforcement learning is needed to solve it or a 
different technique
2. Recognize states, the role of an agent, its actions, and environment for a given 
reinforcement learning problem
3. Select the most appropriate reinforcement learning algorithm for a problem at hand
4. Implement the overall solution in Python
